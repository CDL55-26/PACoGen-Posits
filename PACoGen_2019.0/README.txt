PACoGen: Posit Arithmetic Core Generator

A parameterized Verilog HDL arithmetic core generator is developed
for posit arithmetic (adder, multiplier and division arithmetic). These 
generators supports the posit standard including rounding to nearest rounding
and can used to generate the Verilog HDL for any combination of Word-Size (N) 
and Exponent-Size (ES).
 

Posit standards are followed from the developer's paper which can be find at
