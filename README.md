PACoGen: Posit Arithmetic Core Generator

A parameterized Verilog HDL posit arithmetic core generator is developed
for posit arithmetic (adder, multiplier and division arithmetic). These 
generators support the posit standard including rounding to nearest rounding 
method and can be used to generate the Verilog HDL for any combination of 
Word-Size (N) and Exponent-Size (ES).

This work is based on Article "PACoGen: A Hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator" available at

Posit standards are followed from the developer's paper which can be find at
